// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Implementation
// Design
// Maintain
// Analysis of Requirements
// Testing & Integration
// Planning

/*The correct steps of software development lifecycle in order are follows:

1. Planning
2. Analysis of Requirement.
3. Design.
4. Implementation.
5. Testing and Integration.
6. Maintain.
